                    Both local
                    and
                    session storages are
                    key-value stores, meaning that they both store data
                    in a
                    dictionary format. The value of each key has to be a string, so if you have complex data structures
                    like objects or arrays, you will need to serialize them using JSON strings.Their main difference is
                    that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user
                    closes its browser window.</p>

                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                    program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.<br>
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly brackets {}.

                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                    operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.



                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                    Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.

                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                    queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                    execution.

                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                    browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded
                    operation.

                    An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack,
                    it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back
                    in for processing.

                    Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                    operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as
                    separate threads.

                    The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is
                    empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current
                    function call is processed.
